The location is directly at the beach and close to the peninsula. We got a motorbike which we easily could park in the garage of the hotel.,"Just small improvements: more hooks in the bathrooms are really, really necessary, sometimes the staff at the breakfast buffet was a little too overzealous when cleaning the plates and on the other side the breakfast buffet was not filled up reguarly when something was empty. Also sometimes the staff couldn‘t really understand english properly. What was unfortune but probably issue to the off-season was that the rooftop was closed.

Ian,Vương Quốc Anh,Cặp đôi,Suite Có Giường Cỡ King Nhìn Ra Biển,1 đêm,"Quite simply, a fantastic experience at what must be one of the best hotels in Danang. The hotel feels very new, and the quality of everything is there to be seen...from furnishings and fixtures to the quality of the bathroom & shower areas. Our room was outstanding, could not fault anything about it, and the view is unbeatable, looking straight out over the ocean. A small thing, but another big tick, even the in-room fridge was set nice and cold...sometimes the small fridges are not cold enough, with no way to amend the setting, but these were bang on.
As with all our Vietnam hotel stays (this was our 5th in 2 weeks) the staff go out of their way to make you feel special and welcomed to the hotel. (Special mention to young Ferb on Reception) The breakfast offering was top notch, well worth a visit even if not staying at the hotel. The pool area is also very nice, with an infinity view out to sea and plenty areas for the kids to play, as well as having an in-pool bar for the grown ups. Genuinely, full of praise for the Awaken, we had only booked 1 night as part of our trip home, but I wish we'd been able to extend it longer.","Could not fault a thing, it was just a shame the hotel was not busier, as it certainly deserves to be.

Administration staff is wonderful and polite but hotel management should improve a lot:
1. Once you take an umbrella because it rains you need so sign a contract, once you give the umbrella back you need to write your signature (!).
2. Every bill you pay, you should sign with signature, why you should still do that in 2024?
3. We ordered a breakfast for 1 additional person day before and hotel staff called us 21:30 PM once we were already sleeping to ask how we would pay - at the buffet or during checkout. It was nonsense to ask such a question once we asked by ourselves day before that we would need additional breakfast and will pay an extra for that...
4. During the checkout we were asked to wait while our room will be checked, we waited 20 minutes and went to the parking garage, then we were stopped to wait again and later staff apologised for all that once they checked our room.

Next, in terms of comfort, the room I stayed is King Club room which is in the 25 storey. Great views from the room especially at night, can see the glittering lights coming off buildings and the bridges. The room smells good, bed is comfortable, toilet and showering areas are separated with 2 basins for washing up.

Breakfast is not fantastic, but having it on the 24 floor club lounge provides good views. But the cocktails session from 5.30pm onwards food tray and drinks are nice. If you want a good breakfast, try the Eco bar at My Khe beach. They serve local Vietnamese and Western breakfast. Sit by the beach to enjoy the breakfast, views and sounds of the waves are amazing.

Koen,Hà Lan,Khách lẻ,Suite Premier Giường Đôi Nhìn Ra Cảnh Thành Phố,20 đêm,"I loved this place - will come back here! I booked 20 nights in the TMS hotel and I loved everyone of them.

It starts with a very warm welcome where you're greeted with a friendly smile, a refreshing cocktail and a Hawaiian like flower necklace. When they asked me if they could take my photo I was a bit hesitant, but when they gave me the printed photo in a lovely welcome frame I was sold.

My room was as hoped. Large, huge bed, huge bathroom with super nice walk-in shower with a big rain shower-head. I had booked a room with city view and that's what I got. I stayed at the 23rd floor and the views were fantastic, I had a nice balcony with seating options and it was simply perfect. What I also loved is the AC which was very sensitive, but in a good way. You could really fine tune the room temp by changing it only 1'C degree up or down.

My room was also very quiet and when the sliding door the balcony is closed you shut out 99% of the outside noises.

I didn't spend much time on the rooftop even though it is a lovely terrace with a good restaurant (I ate here once). The rooftop infinity pool is very relaxed, but it only offers a few beach beds so if you want to spend some time there you have to be early. I couldn't care less as right in front of the hotel there's a long-stretched white sandy beach where you can enjoy the sun and sea in a perfect way. For only EUR 1,35 you can rent a bed for the day and get some refreshments too. The beach wasn't crowded when I stayed there and there's a lot of space if you want to have some more space. But again, this beach is plenty big and you will never feel crowded.

What else? Well to my opinion the most important was the genuine feel of the hospitality in TMS hotel. Each and every team member was fantastic and incredibly service oriented and friendly. A big shout out and THANK YOU to Thanh Thào working in the small coffee corner in the lobby.",,10,I Loved every minute of my stay,TMS Hotel Da Nang Beach

Additionally we asked who we spoke with at the front desk to find out why we were told incomplete information and no one was able to say who we spoke with.

Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !!","This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. 

Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5.30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you....","9,0","Really, lovely hotel and great location on the beach",TMS Hotel Da Nang Beach

Thanh,Việt Nam,Khách lẻ,"Phòng Superior 1 Giường King, Hướng Biển, Ban Công",3 đêm,Room with ocean view,"My experience with Four Points by Sheraton is generally good (fast check-in process; friendly and dedicated room service and bar staff). However, during my last morning at the hotel, there were issues at the buffet breakfast restaurant (level 3) that made my experience incompleted:
1. As I couldn't eat much and didn't want to waste food, I only took a small amount, just enough to eat. After putting my food on the table, I went to get water and when I came back all my food had been thrown away by the staff. I feel uncomfortable with this behavior. The staff should have asked my opinion before throwing all the food away like that. Furthermore, I feel that the staff works like a machine, only focusing on clearing the table without being tactful, not paying attention to customers and wasting food unnecessarily.
2. At the beverage counter, there are several types of vegetable and fruit juices. I saw watermelon juice but there was only about half a glass left. I asked the staff if I could have watermelon juice? The staff replied that that was it, watermelon juice was only for private room. Because they still have leftovers, they leave them here for other guests. I asked the staff that I had seen watermelon juice served in previous sessions to all guests and they said it was watermelon juice mixed with other juices, not pure watermelon??? It's funny that watermelon, a fruit that is so popular, low cost, and very common in every hotel restaurant, is a rarity at a hotel like Four Points. Besides, the staff's response made customers feel unappreciated and feel like a kind of secondary guests. I will consider whether I should return to Four Points for my next vacation.
3. And finally, I would like to privately feedback the above to Four Points but cannot find a channel to contact (email, phone or QR code...). I went to the website to find a contact but couldn't find it. So, via Booking.com's survey, hope the hotel can read it.","8,0",Rất tốt,Four Points by Sheraton Danang

The communication flows in the hotel have severe room to improve. 
My partner got stuck in an elevator with 9 people. They rang the bell and asked for help. They heard someone but nothing seemed to happen. No ongoing communication to keep people from panicking, no action. 
Only when I alerted the rooftop bar an engineer sprang I to action. But even at that point no communication flow to the people inside nor to me.

David,Úc,Phòng gia đình,"Phòng Superior 1 Giường King, Hướng Biển, Ban Công",3 đêm,The staff are lovely and friendly.,"We could not stand another night! Left earlier than we booked for and decided to stay at a hotel nearby. 

The issue was black mould on the walls. Terrible upkeep of this supposedly upmarket hotel. The entire building has a musty smell that is covered by a staff member continuously walking around with deodoriser. 


Details we want to share but you may not want to read:
My wife has severe allergies to any mould. The first room we were given was appalling (see photos) and her allergies broke out immediately. We returned to the Lobby and waited over 2 hours for them to find us another room. 
When they found a room my wife inspected before we moved our luggage and it also had mould. They showed us a 3rd room and it was better (still had some mould but not as bad). The manager tried to suggest the black was ""glue"" from the wallpaper... Glue doesn't cause her allergies to flare up, mould does. 

After 2 sleepless nights we couldn't take anymore and decided to cut our stay short and find another hotel with vacancies in the area. 

Acknowledgements:
The manager did try to help us. He also gave us 2 free massage tickets. Although, he took one of them back after realising each one was for 2 people. He then explained how we ""have to appreciate how difficult it has been for him."" (Direct quote He said to me). After taking back the massage voucher he then gave me 2 free beers in the lobby bar. 
Seems they lack understanding that we were the customer and weren't getting sleep because of the atrocious state of their rooms. Expecting us to have sympathy for him somehow... 

We would recommend you choose very carefully and consider some of the other hotels in the area. Our experience with Four Points by Sheraton was horrific and we would not want anyone else to have a similar experience.","3,0",Kém,Four Points by Sheraton Danang

The design of the room has the smoke detector directly above the bed, which flashes all night long. When the lights are out it is magnified. The hotel is aware of the problem and offers an eye mask.
Staying on lower floors means you have to wait for elevators repeatedly (full from higher floors), especially at peak hours, which in the morning if you're trying to leave at a specific time for a work meeting is very frustrating (walking 8 flights of stairs not a preferred option).","4,0",Noisy and not restful rooms.

2. Not centrally located, you need a taxi to go to the centre as it is quite a long walk away.

3. The glass auto-sliding doors at the front of the building does not have a sticker on them. In certain light conditions, it looks like the door is open, even though it is actually closed. Unfortunately, I walked straight into the glass door at speed (in the afternoon on my way out), and bruised my knee on the first day. I reported my injury in the evening to the front desk and even stated the date/time when it happened so she could check, but the staff did not understand a word. She asked me to use a translator app and I typed into the app. . I specifically asked for medicated oil to help rub into the bruise (next day is ok too given that I stayed for 3 nights), and I provided feedback that they need to put stickers on the door to avoid similar future incidents. The staff I spoke to, said they will put stickers on the door during the next day. I received no compensation, no medicated oil, and no sticker on the door. I am utterly disappointed by the staff in handling this matter. At the very least, I would have expected them to make the doors safer for other customers, but that did not happen during my stay.

On checking in I was given a room which was completely different from the photographs shown online and was infact the smaller room and not the bigger suite which I had booked. I complained and they said that the pictures online were wrong. I asked for a refund, but they finally agreed to give me the the suite which I had booked originally. I wish my troubles had ended there but it was not to be.

My room was not cleaned even once during my stay even though it was mentioned to the reception multiple times. They said they were too busy and short staffed ( this coming from a major 5 star hotel and any random boutique hotel amazed me.) They promised everyday that my room would be cleaned the next day but that didn't happen. Because of this I didn't receive my complimentary water. I tried calling the reception multiple times to get water but no one answered. I would be out the whole day exploring Danang so they ample time to do basic housekeeping but clearly this was not important to them. I did receive a note of apology on the 5th morning of my stay promising to take care of the situation however when I returned at night the room was again not cleaned as usual.

I'm not one to leave bad reviews normally but I can't imagine how one a hotel as big as this can't do something as simple as basic housekeeping.

The only good thing were the views from my room, which I almost didn't get if i didn't ask for a refund so in short great location, good views but horrible service and terrible staff. Won't be back here for sure.","3,0",Poor service,Meliá Vinpearl Danang Riverfront

Geburtstag bekam ich ein Törtchen aufs Zimmer und einen lieben Brief vom Front of House. Tolles Fitnessstudio! Haben einen Abend im Restaurant gegessen - PERFEKTES STEAK! Großes Lob an die Küche bitte nochmal!","Sind als ""Backpacker"" angereist, d.h. mit Rucksack, aber ordentlich, ganz normal gekleidet!
Wurden an der Rezeption extrem skeptisch begrüßt, mussten den Welcome-Drink im Stehen trinken, während jeder andere erst Mal in der Lounge willkommen geheißen wurde - und das alles obwohl wir eins der teuersten Zimmer des Hotels gebucht hatten, um dort meinen runden Geburtstag zu feiern! 
Das Hotel hat da direkt in den ersten Sekunden einen negativen Eindruck hinterlassen und konnte dann nur noch verlieren. Da sieht man Mal was eine gute Rezeption ausmacht, der erste Eindruck ist so wichtig; wir kommen selbst aus der gehobenen Gastronomie und wissen wovon wir reden. 
Wir wurden auch nicht aufs Zimmer begleitet wie üblich, sondern mussten den Weg zum Aufzug und zur Suite selbst suchen. Dort war es dann ganz hübsch, allerdings wie gesagt, nach so einem ersten Eindruck fallen uns dann ganz andere Dinge auf: leere Wasserflasche mit alten Zigarettenstummeln vom Vorgänger auf dem Balkon, Staub unter dem Esstisch, dreckiges Handtuch im Bad. Reklamiert haben wir nur die Zigarettenstummel, welche entfernt wurden samt Entschuldigungsschreiben.
Beim Frühstück ist noch anzumerken, dass es sehr schade ist in einem Hotel dieser Klasse, dass nur am Morgen der Tisch eingedeckt wird. Kommt man etwas später (halb 9!) liegen schon keine Stoffservietten mehr auf den Plätzen und ab halb 10 wird begonnen das Buffet abzubauen/für den Abend einzudecken, was eine recht ungemütliche Stimmung macht. 

Alles in allem war es okay, aber unsere Erwartungen waren deutlich höher.

Dung,Việt Nam,Phòng gia đình,Suite Junior - Hướng Biển,2 đêm,"- Điều mình thích đầu tiên là nhân viên cực kì nhiệt tình và thân thiện. Ai cũng nhẹ nhàng và chu đáo với khách hàng. lần này mình đi em bé nhà mình mới đi nhà trẻ, đúng giai đoạn khủng hoảng nên có làm ồn và làm phiền cô chú nhân viên (nhất là khu vực nhà hàng) nhiều. Thật may vì mọi người vẫn niềm nở khiến vợ chồng mình bớt ngại.
- Vị trí quá tuyệt vời để tận hưởng kì nghỉ, view phòng nhìn ra biển siêu đẹp. Bạn bé nhà mình cứ ngủ dậy là đòi tắm biển và tắm bể bơi cá heo.
- Tiện nghi trong phòng rất tốt, phòng sạch, giường rất dễ chịu. Gối thì cao quá đối với gia đình mình nhưng có vẻ ks nào cũng dùng cái gối cao quá ấy. Khi mình yêu cầu cũng được hỗ trợ mang tới 1 cái gối vừa hơn và có cả gối cho em bé.
- Bữa trưa phục vụ tại phòng rất ngon. Giá tiền bữa trưa này rất hợp lí. Buffet sáng khá ổn.
- Có lẽ nếu k thông qua booking mình chưa chắc đã book được phòng đẹp mà giá rẻ như vậy. Lần này đi ĐN mình ở 2 ks đều tốt, nhưng DLG mình đánh giá cao hơn hẳn. Giá tiền k chênh lệch quá nhiều (chỉ chênh lệch 250k/đêm) nhưng trải nghiệm cao cấp hơn rất nhiều.
Ảnh là view từ phòng của mình. View ưng cực kì ạ.","Giá giặt là của ks quá cao và không niêm yết trong tài liệu ở phòng. Giá của dịch vụ này sẽ có ở tờ giấy nhân viên đưa trước khi khách gửi giặt nên mng có thể xem kĩ trước. Nhưng mình thấy giá giặt vậy là cao quá (nhà mình giặt đồ có khoảng 20 cái khăn xô của con, mấy bộ đồ tính ra khoảng 3-4kg đồ khô nhưng giá lên tới 1.2tr, khi hỏi đã đc lễ tân giai đáp và các bạn ý cũng hỗ trợ giảm 30% giá giặt). Giá dịch vụ giặt chưa phù hợp chính là điểm trừ duy nhất khiến mình k rate đc 10 điểm.","9,0",Sự lựa chọn khá tuyệt cho kì nghỉ. Mọi người nên chọn ạ,DLG Hotel Danang

Nuray,Hàn Quốc,Khách lẻ,Phòng Deluxe Giường Đôi Nhìn Ra Biển,5 đêm,"I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel:

-First and foremost, hotel staff was great. They always welcome you with a smile on their faces and are so kind and helpful. Be it the security waiting outside, receptionists or staff in the restaurant, they were all so nice and helpful.

- The cleaning staff did a great job, room was as clean as it could be! It was not cleaned the first two days and it turned out I pressed the “do not disturb” button on the wall, next to the lights while looking for the lights. So if you check in late night as I did, FYI! 

- The hotel has a great location. You cross the street and you are on the beach. The only issue is, traffic lights or respecting the lights is not a thing in Vietnam. Thus, crossing the road is a little bit risky for fellow westerners who are not used to cars/motorbikes driving on you and honking while you try to cross the street. But it will be the same wherever you go on that beach line.

- It is also walking distance to the restaurants. Get out of the hotel, turn left and you will see famous seafood restaurants in a few minutes. But I would recommend you to turn right, walk 10-15 minutes and try other seafood restaurants which are basically 30%-50% cheaper for the same fancy seafood like giant lobsters and you will not have to wait an hour to be served. Unfortunately I discovered it on my last night!

- I used the airport shuttle from the airport to the hotel and highly recommend it. I took a taxi on my way back to the airport and it is half the price of the shuttle service. They are both cheap anyway but when you take the shuttle from the airport to the hotel, you know you will not be scammed as opposed to taking the taxi. 

- I also asked how I could visit Lady Buddha statue and reception arranged me a car to do some sightseeing. I also recommend that since the driver will wait for you while you are visiting those places and you will have a comfortable trip.","- Breakfast was a hit or miss. It was a giant ASIAN food buffet. And as you may know, Asian breakfast is not much different from Asian dinner. Thus, you will love it if you are okay with having fried rice, sauted beef with oyster sauce and veggies or sushi for breakfast. Or else it will be a bit challenging.

- Also, you will see that the food is not replaced with the same food when it is finished. Thus, breakfast around 7:30 am is slightly better than breakfast around 9am. Likewise, there were some people who were literally taking all the papaya, rambutan and pineapples to their tables (around 2kg each) which were being replaced with watermelon. It is kind of annoying if you want to have one of those fruits and see the same people taking all the fruits to their tables everyday!

- If you decide to take the tuktuk, reception can arrange it for you. However, check the price with the reception before getting in the car since the driver tried to charge me more than double the amount I was quoted. It was still cheap but knowing you are being overcharged was unsettling.

- Unfortunately smoking is allowed in the hotel. You will see people smoking in the lobby or Sonata restaurant. So it might be an issue if you intend to spend some time there and are sensitive to smoking indoors.

- The worst part of my stay was sleepless nights. I had horrible neighbors on the floor. An English speaking family coming to the room from 3am to 5am, fighting with their little son to make him go to sleep and then fighting with each other since the boy did not want to sleep. And unfortunately calling the reception at 5am to remind those guests that people were sleeping did not work either. A Vietnamese family with at least 2 boys going to breakfast/beach around 7am in the morning, arguing with the father and each other and shouting on all their way in the hall. A Korean family doing the same around 8am. So, as you can imagine, I had many sleepless nights despite the comfort of the bed.","9,0","Definitely recommended, hopefully with less noisy guests on the same floor!",DLG Hotel Danang

Det var alltid flere vegetar-alternativer, kaker, oppskåret frukt, musli, youghurt (visstnok hjemmelaget). Fikk to små flasker med vann hver dag på rommet. Vi hadde sn suite og der var sengen stor og god. Hotellet delte ut svært gode og tykke håndklær ved bassengene. Når noen forlot solsengene, så byttet hotellet ut håndklærne me en gang.

Für manche mag das 80er Jahre Stil sein, in z.B. China, obwohl hier Vietnam normal. Das Hotel und die Ausstattung sind in einem tadellosen Zustand. Es ist nichts verschlissen oder schmutzig. Man kann es kaum glauben aber alles war Tip Top. Ich war 5 Nächte im Hotel und hatte eine Executive Suite mit Meerblick, das ist natürlich Luxus aber es gab bei Booking.com ein Super Angebot.... daher war ich am Anfang sehr skeptisch, weil sich hinter 50% Angeboten meist etwas negatives versteckt. hier aber echte ***** 5 Sterne.
Das Zimmer bzw. die Suite sehr geräumig, 2. Toilette separat, Das BadDusche und Badewanne, 2 Waschbecken, Bademäntel, Handtücher und Pflegeprodukte. Alles sehr sauber und gepflegt. Das Bett groß und bequem, im Eingangsraum Tisch und Couch. 2x Swimmingpool outdoor einmal im 3. Stock und einmal im Erdgeschoss vor dem Hotel mit zusätzlicher Terrasse, abgetrennt und erhöht aber direkt an der Promenaden Hauptstraße. Die Liegen sehr bequem, dicke Polster. Große Strandtücher werden am Pool ausgegeben. Am Strand gibt es leider keine Hoteleigenen Liegen. Hier muss extra bezahlt werden wie so überall. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist reichhaltig mit kalten, warmen und süßen Speisen. Zusätzlich gibt es frische Eier/Omelett und Asiatische Nudelsuppe. Die Lage des Hotels ist für diese Gegend sehr gut, Quasi direkt am Strand. Der Strand ist weitläufig, das Meer immer ein bisschen unruhig bis auf ganz Früh am Morgen oder am Abend. Restaurants, kleine Supermärkte, Food Trucks sind in 3 bis 5 Gehminuten erreichbar.","Was mir nicht gefallen hat das hat hier nichts zu suchen. Man soll schon sachlich bleiben.

There is also very nice terrace at the roof. Hotel is 5 minutes walk away from the Dragon Bridge and night market.

There is no ability to open any kind of window in the room. We were staying in the hotel for just one night so it didn't bother us much, but for a longer stay I would prefer to have ability to open the window and not depend just on air conditioning.

Goncalo,Bồ Đào Nha,Cặp đôi,Phòng Deluxe Có Giường Cỡ Queen,2 đêm,The view from the room was nice and also the location was really good.,"To begin with, the bedrooms are just too tiny. There is not enough space to place our luggage, so we had to put it on the floor and therefore, no space to walk on the room. We actually put the label outside the door of ""no disturbing"" so we didnt have to take our luggage from the floor for the cleaning ladies.

The bathroom was also really tiny (so tiny that the door to close the bathroom is the same to close the shower). While in the shower, with the closed door, there was no light inside. The shower was just too complicated to use. We left our stay without understanding how to use it. Why complicate?
Please, equip the bedrooms appropriately. 

The worst part came in the end. We wanted to use the pool and the staff told us there was ""a private event"" going on in the rooftop and therefore, guests could not use the pool. This is not from this planet. How is it possible to do ""private events"" on a hotel proibiting guests to use the hotel facilities????? When we booked this hotel, one of the filters was having a pool, and here we are, being rejected by our own hotel to relax during our stay. The staff was super rude when comunicating this.

Juha,Phần Lan,Cặp đôi,Phòng Premier Có Giường Cỡ Queen Hướng Sông Nhìn Ra Cảnh Hoàng Hôn,3 đêm,"Tämä hotelli poikkeaa monesta muusta hotellista, koska tämä tuntuu hieman omatoimi hotellilta, jossa toiminnot on automatisoitu, mutta tämä on vain hyvä asia. Hotelli on uusi ja sen kyllä huomaa kaikessa. Uloskirjautumisaika on sama aika kuin sisäänkirjautumisaika, joten tämä on erinomainen niille matkustajille, jotka sisäänkirjautuvat myöhään. Hotellissa on pyykinpesumahdollisuus noin 2€ per koneellinen/kuivaaminen. Pyykinpesukone annostelee pyykkiaineen automaattisesti ja maksu suoritetaan kortilla automaattiin. Hotellin kuntosali on parhaita kuntosaleja verraten Da Nangin muihin hotelleihin. Maittava aamupala hyvillä jokinäkymillä. Hotellissa kattouima-allas baareineen, mistä pystyy ihailemaan Da Nangia. Hotellin lähettyvillä sijaitsee Son Tra Night Market ja Dragon Bridge ja monia ravintoloita. Valitsemani hotellihuone oli juuri sopivan kompakti yhdelle/kahdelle hengelle. Huoneen isoista ikkunoista pystyi iltaisin ihailemaan kaupungin valaistusta sekä jokiristeilijöitä.

Joen vasta rannalla sijaitsee saman yrityksen toinen aivan vastaava hotelli. Jos haluat oleskella hieman rauhallisemmalla alueella ja hotellissa, jossa on kattouima-allas niin valitse tämä hotelli. Jos haluat, että lähettyvillä on ravintoloita ja yöelämää niin valitse vasta rannalla oleva hotelli. Itse yövyin molemmissa vaihtelun vuoksi. Itse pidin tästä hotellista enemmän, koska täällä oli vähemmän asiakkaita, parempi kuntosali, paremmat näköalat ja biljaripöytä.","Sijainnin puolesta parhaat ravintolat ja yöelämä hieman kauempana, joten pitää käyttää Grap kyytiä.","9,0",Tuyệt hảo,Wink Hotel Danang Riverside - 24hrs Stay & Rooftop with Sunset View

Chúng tôi muốn sử dụng dịch vụ sauna nhưng do spa ko có lịch trống sớm vậy nên chỉ xác nhận cho chúng tôi lúc 11:00, chúng tôi nghĩ rằng nếu chúng tôi sử dụng dịch vụ sauna xong thì có thể sẽ bị muộn giờ check out nên có xin hỗ trợ check out muộn 5 đến 10p nhưng thật bất ngờ khi lễ tân gọi lại xác nhận là chỉ hỗ trợ cho chúng tôi trả phòng muộn từ 1 đến 2 phút, cho minh hỏi 1 đến 2 phút có đủ thời gian để thang máy khách sạn đi từ tầng 6 xuống sảnh không vậy ạ? Vậy nên chúng tôi đành hủy lịch đi spa và kéo vali ra khỏi phòng lúc 11:57 để kịp đung 12:00 có mặt tại sảnh trả phòng theo như chính sách của khách sạn.
Góp ý thêm là nhân viên spa làm việc chưa được chuyên nghiệp ban đầu xác nhận lịch cho chúng tôi là 11:00 nhưng sau đó khi tôi gọi lại spa kiểm tra lại dịch vụ thì báo rằng đã báo nhầm khung giờ cho chúng tôi, khung giờ trống là 11:30, do không thể trả phòng muộn nên chúng tôi báo luôn là hủy không sử dụng dịch vụ sauna, sau đó ít phút thì spa lại gọi bảo là đã thu xếp cho chúng tôi lúc 11:00 nhưng lúc đó chúng tôi không còn thấy hứng thú nữa nên đã từ chối.
Thật tiếc khi chúng tôi không có nhiều thời gian trải nghiệm hết dịch vụ của khách sạn nhưng mong góp ý của chúng tôi sẽ góp phần làm cho dịch vụ của các bạn ngày càng tốt hơn.","6,0",Dễ chịu,Radisson Hotel Danang

There is an employee named HOAN. We called and asked for a little delay in leaving and we got half an hour at exactly 12:30, but I was surprised by a call from this rude employee at 12:15 telling me that if I did not come down within 5 minutes, I would be fined an amount of money, I do not remember exactly How much was it, but I think 50 or 100 dollars, this is rude, I am a respected guest and I am not a thief for him to talk to me in this way, if one day I decide to not living here he will be the reason. 
I hope there strict action with him.

The second story

There is an employee her name is SARAH
When we went down to check out from the hotel, we were delayed by this employee, there was a spoon missing, and is it my problem? I told her that everything on the table, i used it on the first day to eating and put it on the table and the other one was new and I did not use it, but she insisted that the loss was from me and I just ate and put it in the same place on the table so it is the problem of the cleaning staff not me, and why would I steal a teaspoon ?? It annoyed me with a lot of asking and this was something abnormal.
Hope to teach her how to speak with the guests.

The highlight for me would be the spa. We had a complimentary sauna for >3 nights of stay and I booked the massages twice - amazing experiences, very professional and of great quality. The massage rooms are sea front, which is another plus.

Besonders hervorzuheben ist das freundliche und zuvorkommende Personal, das stets bemüht ist, den Gästen einen schönen Aufenthalt zu bereiten.

Das Frühstücksbuffet ist umfangreich und bietet eine große Auswahl. Lediglich die Auswahl an Käse- und Wurstwaren könnte noch etwas verbessert werden, um auch hier eine noch größere Vielfalt zu bieten.

Der Strand ist in nur 2-3 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar und bietet angenehme Liegen, die zu einem geringen Preis genutzt werden können. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis für Getränke und Snacks am Strand ist ebenfalls angemessen, allerdings gehört dieser Bereich nicht zum Hotel, da das Hotel keinen eigenen Strand hat.","Ein kleiner Minuspunkt ist der verhältnismäßig kleine Pool des Hotels. Es gibt nur wenige Stühle und diese sind schnell vergriffen, sodass man sehr früh am Pool sein muss, um einen Platz zu bekommen. Es gibt lediglich zwei Liegen außerhalb des Poolbereichs und diese sind ebenfalls schnell belegt. Insgesamt gibt es eher Sitzgelegenheiten als Liegen, was den Komfort etwas einschränken kann.

I’ve never seen so much food but yet so little I wanted to eat. 
This however seems to be the case in a few hotels I’ve stayed in in Vietnam. 
Suggestions I would make is to offer bacon, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes to accompany the variety of eggs on offer. Not a fan of stir fries or soups for breakfast. 
Larger selection of fresh fruit and yogurts would be nice. 
Coffee - a must have for most of us in the morning. I was shocked to have to pay for a latte. 
I didn’t like the Vietnamese coffee on offer. 
Pillows - ones to soft the other is too thick which unfortunately I didn’t sleep well for the duration. I didn’t however actually ask for a different pillow, so they may have had alternatives. 

Lastly - training in cocktail making. for the high prices charged it was very disappointing to receive a thrown together cocktail. We tested a lot on the menu and most didn’t taste like they should.

The location is really good, closed to My Khe beach, An Thuong night market is around the corner, many restaurants are around, which help me to have good breakfasts during my stay. My room is ocean front which helps to view the ocean right in front of me, it would be better if there is balcony so i can fully smell the ocean. The room is big, which is suitable for me to work at the hotel sometimes, the light control is near my bed, which is very convenient. If you visit Danang for tourism only, you can skip what i don't like, if you visit Danang for work like me, you can read what i do not like about the hotel and the staff.","if you read the welcome book after you check-in, there is no mentioning about people who travels to Danang/this hotel to stay for work/business, this is origin of my complaints. 
Breakfast: most, perhaps all, hotels in Danang is offering buffer breakfast, as a result quality of breakfast is low, to my standard, however this is expected by me. What i do not like is this hotel does not offer a la carte breakfast, which saves my time and quality would be perhaps better. During my 14 nights stay, i skipped my breakfasts at this hotel, instead, i went to some restaurants around the corner for my breakfasts, which saved my time and quality is not the best, but acceptable to me. 
Staff: they do not distinguish which guest is for tourism only, which guest is for business, they assume all guests are for tourism, they can ask but they chose not to. They seemed surprised when i told them i stayed alone and they even asked why i stayed alone? If they asked, i would expect them to do everything they could to save my time during check-in and check-out but they didn't. Tourists might have plenty of time but i did and do not. This is problem of hotel management, who do not train their staff well.","7,0",Good for tourists but not good for business,Rosamia Da Nang Hotel

You cant compare its services with Marriot or Hilton. I have been traveling last 30 yrs and have been to many many countries but have never experienced people stopping me taking one extra whole fruit or a cake to room from breakfast buffet. It happened here. I was stopped and told I am not allowed to bring food to room. I had my reasons, we have near 2 yrs and 8yrs old kids sleeping. Often they dont want to sleep longer or dont want have breakfast. So what I was trying to do was hand carrying one slice of bread and one small slice of cake! I was very shocked! Explained to them but they didn’t understand and insisted me not to. 
During breakfast the chef who was making egg omelette, used her finger (without gloves) to pick up something from the pan while frying the egg! I immediately told her, asked her to changed she didn’t even look at me! 
Next day same happed to my son when he was hand carrying couple of banana bread slices for his sister (my daugher) as she has never been to breakfast and wants to sleep through. He was stopped and told to leave those food! We were 4 of us and had booking with breakfast. 
Secondly I have never stayed in a world class hotel where there is a big cockroach 🪳 flying in the room. I had to kill it. Photo attached! 
I found too many people in the reception and are talking between each other on something else when I am asking something. Also I had difficulty in communicating, its not English I mean its the willingness of the hotel stuff to help me!

I read from other reviews that it may be noise during night time, the truth is sometimes there is music at the beach and it will only last till 10pm at night. The hotel has no control of it cos the music is from the resturant at the beach, yet the hotel keeps monitor the noise and report to police if it is over time. I stayed there for two nights and one night there is music, however, it stopped before 10pm. Meanwhile, if you close the balcony, there will hv no sound. 
Staffs at the hotel or at the resturant are supper nice and they are very curious of how is our stay, cos they want to improve their service, can feel every staffs give their heart for their hotel to serve us better.

The room was a decent size and was clean. The beds were comfortable and the air con worked well. The balcony was a good size and would have had a lovely view if it wasn’t so foggy. Having a separate door on the toilet was a nice touch.

The steam room, sauna and pool were nice but the pool was freezing. We still enjoyed our swim and cocktails by the pool!

Breakfast was good as were the cocktails at the rooftop bar.

There was a loud party across the street at night but the GRO spoke to each group individually at breakfast and apologised which was unnecessary but showed good care.

Secondly, this is very small but being a 5 star hotel it would be nice if they had a smart TV in the room with Netflix.

Bathroom very nice especially tub and great ventilation. Good walk-in wardrobe and plenty shelving next to desk to put all our clothes in. We were there for 7 nights so it made our stay more comfortable. Staff friendly and attentive especially the 2 guest relations officers. They would come to speak to us at breakfast every 1-2 days to check how our stay was and would attend to any issues/questions. Our shower drain was very slow to drain and they sent someone to fix it straight away. Room service, house keeping and reception is 24hrs. Free water bottles provided daily and more can be ordered as needed. Bartender named Chi (we think) at Speakeasy Bar on rooftop took great care in making our drinks perfect. Good gym, sauna, steam room and pool. Nice spa treatments. Breakfast buffet had good variety, nice fruit, juices, delicious pho/noodle soups, and great coffee. Room service food was good. We'd definitely stay here again.","Nothing really, but just some suggestions for improvement. The pool area would have been better if there was a spa, if glass fence was kept clean to give a clear view of the beach and they played more chilled out music instead of pop/dance (btw I like pop/dance but it didn't feel right here). Windows in rooms could have been better sound proofed as we can hear all the street noise start from 5.30am or if there is a function across road in evening as they love the volume on the entertainment super loud lol (only happened 1 night luckily). TV would have been better if it allowed screen mirroring so I could watch my Netflix or YouTube off my phone ... or better still if it had Netflix and internet access. Breakfast was overall good, but some dishes could be better e.g. bacon, sausages, and have more hot vegetarian options.","9,0",Great place to stay. Highly recommended.,Sel de Mer Hotel & Suites

Very polite and attentive staff, quick and reactive, yet kind and welcoming - a great example of Eastern hospitality.
We appreciated the welcome ice tea for all our party - much needed with 105°F outside!

We took a twin room with a sea view and a balcony - unobstructed view of the long beach of Da Nang, just super. The room was US-standard in size, rather big , with large bathroom, big TV screen, well designed and with a perfect and intuitive a/c control.

Breakfast is a highlight. Much choice of Vietnamese as well as western food, very good quality and presentation. Nice breakfast room, large and with no major odors. Apparently bottomless supply of food. Polite maitre constantly checking for quality and customer satisfaction.

The hotel is located to more quiet northern end of the strip, with a huge portion of the beach waiting for your early morning undisturbed bath :) Nice, quiet and reasonably big infinity pool, not on rooftop, in case you need some shadow. Large and nice gym nearby the pool. A taxi ride to/from the airport takes less than 15 minutes. Attractive Hoi An can be reached by taxi in less than 40 minutes.

Considering also the fare, I would say one of the best hotel stays I had over the last few years. We just felt welcome, relaxed, and stunned by the gorgeous view. Would totally recommend, and hope to be there again soon.",,10,Xuất sắc,Sel de Mer Hotel & Suites

Adhichau,Việt Nam,Cặp đôi,Phòng Superior Có Giường Cỡ King Nhìn Ra Biển,4 đêm,"The hotel is right on the beach (across the road), rooms are modern and comfortable. One thing I would like to inform you, if you want to have some good food don't fall for the taxi drivers outside, just turn right on the road and walk down, you will come to a street full of restaurants on both sides of the road. All of these places have good food, just walk along and you can try over 100 places to eat there. I found this road to have lots of good places than the main road where most of these places are large establishments with sea food. There is a Beach Club just 1KM walk down also a good place for drinks and some full moon parties. 

The guest relationship manager was the best, she was always present while check-in, morning breakfast and even while we checked out, I give 100% to her she was a mini Wiki of knowledge, with a big smile. I think this is one of the few hotels who have got it right ""customers come first"". 

Next time I will definitely be staying here.","Now, this is nothing to do with the hotel, but across the road there are two events places, where they do weddings, parties etc. and like anything in Vietnam they have to do karaoke that goes on till 10PM, so if you plan to sleep early good luck with that, lots of these guys think they can sing but believe me its a stretch.","9,0",Cozy place where you feel you are the only customer.,Sel de Mer Hotel & Suites

I stayed on level 19 and could hear neighboring businesses blasting music at night - so just be prepared for some noise nuisances which may be unavoidable at times.

We felt some aspects of the room could have been designed better, for example, the sliding door that opens to the balcony could be collapsed instead of stacked to one side. Stacking it effectively blocked 1/3 of the view. Also the shower does not have any place to put toiletries, we had to put the things on the floor.

Breakfast buffet egg station could do better. My sunny side up was soaked in oil, and the scrambled egg lacked the rich buttery flavor. Out of the eggs we tried, omelette was the best.

The hotel should place instructions on how to ""on"" the steam room. During my stay, if I needed to ""on"" it I had to ask a staff outside (so far is male) to enter the female toilet and help to ""on"" it. This left me feeling insecure during my use of the hot sauna that anytime a male could just walk in the female toilet to render assistance if needed.","8,0",Not bad,Sel de Mer Hotel & Suites

There is no soundproofing in the room whatsoever and and even with the balcony doors fully closed, the noise is unbearable. We had to leave the room during that time. Complaints to the staff had no effect, no action was taken to make things right. We were on one of the higher floors, I imagine it could be even worse on the lower floors.

There were few other minor issues like leaking shower cabin or mediocre breakfast quality (especially the eggs!) but we would be fairly happy with the stay if it wasn't for the noise.

I asked to give us a quiet family room when we were checking in, as I haven’t had a good sleep for days in previous half of the trip in Hanoi. I was then told by the reception staff that they never had any complaint of noise from guests so I should not need to worry. It turned out that our beach view family room on level 8 was super noisy. The street traffic noise, the loud party music and karaoke for 2 consecutive nights from the restaurant or club across the street right in the beach, really negatively affected our entire experience. The balcony doors were not sound proof at all. When asking if possible to change to a quieter room, we were told the family room is only available up to Level 9 so changing room wouldn’t make any difference. I am not sure if that’s true, but we decided to stay put with this information from the reception staff. 
2. upon checking out, we were falsely blamed for breaking a glass in the room. Maybe just because we had 2 kids staying? I am 100% sure no glass was broken by us during our stay, it might be their cleaning staff who broke it during cleaning and blamed on us. Rushing to check out to catch our flight, my husband did not bother to argue and just paid for the mysteriously broken glass.

Es liegt am Ende vom Strand. leider hat das Hotel am Strand keine Liegen. zumindest eine Dusche wäre nett gewesen. Wer also Strandurlaub geniessen möchte kann ich dieses Hotel an dieser Stelle nicht empfehlen. 
Hinzu war das Frühstück nicht 5 Sterne würdig. Jeden 2. Tag das gleiche Essen. Echt enttäuschend. 
das schlimmste ist, dass man uns für den Altkleider Sack berechnet. Kostet zwar nur 25K dong. Aber selbst die 3 Sternen Hotels stellen das nicht Rechnung. für mich ein Unding und sollte geändert werden.

Vì gia đình tôi không thích hợp với phòng ở tầng cao nên tôi có đề nghị được ở phòng tầng 6-10. Nhân viên yêu cầu tôi chờ đến 15.00 theo quy định vì yêu cầu của tôi chưa được đáp ứng ngay. Tôi biết tại thời điểm này ks khách cũng ít nên đề nghị cho tôi nhận một phòng 2 giường, các yêu cầu khác của tôi sắp xếp sau vì chiều đó tôi ra khỏi ks sớm. Không những không được đáp ứng mà thái độ của nhân viên lễ tân thiếu chuyên nghiệp, cứng nhắc và coi thường khách.
Tôi sẽ không bao giờ đến ở ks này, và tôi biết trước tôi đã có rất nhiều người góp ý nhưng ks không tiếp thu và thay đổi. Thiết nghỉ, kinh doanh du lịch mà như mấy c lễ tân hôm ấy thì ks đi đến đâu?

- Excellent service: we got a free upgrade thanks to booking.com promotion from a no view, no window room to a twin room with partial seats view so I was happy enough but Định the bellman made us even more happy as he walk our luggage to the room and realised we are travelling as a couple so he ask if we want to request a room change to double room and then the hotel is very nice to change it for free. Such a very thoughtful gesture. Định really went extra miles for customer’s satisfaction. He helped us a lot with hotel information and taxi, too. Other staffs are also very welcoming. They really exceeded my expectations which premade from reading other reviews. Oh, and we got welcome drinks and food too :)
- Location: very near the beach and An Thuong areas where lots of shops and services are available. Our room is on the back corner of the hotel, floor 21 so we got a very beautiful view of the beach and the city while stayed away from the noise in the beach in the evening.","- The building and room was built a long time ago I guess so furniture and carpets look a bit old and worn out here and there, although still very clean.

Jewell,Mỹ,Cặp đôi,Phòng Có Giường Cỡ King Nhìn Ra Sông,3 đêm,"The hotel was very nice. Everyone that we encountered was accommodating and helpful. We arrived early and wanted an early check in. The front desk accommodated us without charge but wanted us to write a review first before even experiencing the hotel. The room did have some issues that were resolved quickly but they were issues. For example the shower knob was broken and we couldn’t turn off the rainfall shower. The was room was very hot all the time and we finally asked on the last night for them to check it. They made some adjustment and it cooled off. Also our tv stopped working , again they replaced it right away. Other than that it was fine. The breakfast buffet is amazing and had many selections.! The location of the hotel is perfect and we had a great view of the Han River and it’s about 1 mile from the dragon bridge. The Han’s market is maybe a 7 minute walk and there is a Starbucks right next door. Overall I would probably stay there again but I really didn’t like how they asked me to write a review BEFORE actually experiencing or seeing the room. Oh and if you’re looking for good Vietnamese food I highly recommend An Thôi which is on the same street about 10 minutes down on the right.

The hotel is conveniently located by the Dragon bridge, but Danang itself is a town with many areas/ districts, so if you prefer being closer to the 'eat streets' or the beach, this may not be the best choice for you.","Everything was great.

Thi,Việt Nam,Phòng gia đình,Phòng Superior 2 Giường Đơn Nhìn Ra Biển,4 đêm,"Có quá nhiều thứ đáng yêu tại khách sạn Nalod này giúp cho nhà mình có kỳ nghỉ đáng nhớ.
1. Khách sạn nằm ở vị thế trung tâm, đối diện bãi tắm 1,2,3. Phòng view biển chính diện tạo cảm giác vô cùng thư thái. Ngay đằng sau khách sạn là cả 1 con đường dài với rất nhiều các địa điểm ăn uống có tiếng mà không phải di chuyển quá xa. Nhà mình ăn tại nhà hàng Hương Đồng mấy bữa luôn, đồ ăn ở đó rất ngon nha.
2. Nhân viên lễ tân luôn niềm nở, nhiệt tình, lịch sự, tư vấn vô cùng có tâm, tỉ mỉ chi tiết mỗi khi gia đình mình cần bất cứ thông tin gì. Đặc biệt ấn tượng với 2 bạn lễ tân là Trâng và Nhi là 2 cô gái tử tế, thân thiện khiến mình có thiện cảm nhất. Bạn Trâng hướng dẫn mình rất cẩn thận khi được hỏi về các địa điểm ăn uống trong thành phố, các dịch vụ khác. Nhi rất dễ gần và tốt tính. Nhà mình đi chơi khi trời trở mây tối trời, bạn chủ động hỏi mình có mang theo ô không, khi được biết mình ngại mang chiếc ô dài có sẵn trong phòng, bạn ấy đã không ngần ngại cho nhà mình mượn ngay chiếc ô gập cá nhân của bạn ấy. Các bạn nam lễ tân cũng rất nhiệt tình, các bạn dọn phòng cũng rất sạch sẽ và tôn trọng không gian riêng của gia đình. 
3. Đồ ăn sáng tại khách sạn cũng thật tuyệt vời. Đa dạng món ăn và đổi thực đơn hàng ngày. Mình rất thích các món mỳ Quảng, hủ tiếu tại khách sạn. Thơm ngon, đậm đà bản sắc của miền Trung
4. Bất ngờ hơn nữa là nhà mình đi chơi về nhận được bánh sinh nhật chúc mừng chồng mình và bánh chia tay khi sắp hết kỳ nghỉ được để sẵn trong phòng với nét chữ viết vô cùng cẩn thận, lời chúc rất đáng yêu
....
Mỗi thứ một chút một thôi nhưng làm nên 1 Đà Nẵng thật xinh đẹp, tình cảm trong gia đình mình. Cảm ơn các bạn nhân viên khách sạn, cảm ơn cả những con người Đà Nẵng từ các bạn lái taxi, những người bán hàng. Rất ưng phong cách làm du lịch tại đây.",Bể bơi chưa được chăm sóc tốt.

Marco,Thụy Sỹ,Cặp đôi,Phòng Superior Giường Đôi Nhìn Ra Biển,6 đêm,Only the Massage,"Where do I start? Why this hotel is even 5 stars on booking.com? 
The Nalod Da Nang hotel is the worst hotel we’ve ever been to.

We booked this hotel from Jan 23-29 and we decided to check out after 3 days because we had a horrible experienced.
One day before we traveled, we contacted the hotel for airport pickup, but unfortunately, the hotel never responded. It was raining when we arrived, we were very mad because if they communicate with us, it’s much easier to travel going to the hotel and it's Luna’s New year so there are not so many taxis (not even a grab). After check-in, we went to our room and found 1 Pantyliner on the floor, disgusting! They don’t even check the room though they had so much time because we arrived around the evening. 
On the next day, we ordered room service and unfortunately, the STAFF doesN'T UNDERSTAND ENGLISH! IS THIS A 5-star? 3x that’s happened. I said I don’t want fries, they bring me a wrong order full of fries or even wrong order even though their Menu is English. The next day I ordered a pot of fish and I was so excited UNFORTUNATELY the pot have PORK BELLY! what recipe is that??? And not on the Menu that a Pot of steamed fish is with a pork belly. Lastly, I went to the breakfast and ordered a cappuccino, later I need to pay after My breakfast, WHERE IS THE FREE BREAKFAST THAT INCLUDED IN MY ROOM? Plus the Save box can carry by a person, not even attached to the wall (check the photos)
The only good thing I’ve experienced here is their massage atleast I had 1 hour to relax after all the terrible experiences. English is a very important communication which the hotel must give attention to. We can't handle what the hotel stress gave so we check out early. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS HOTEL! NOT EVEN RECOMMENDED TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS! 

Ps. I hope booking.com check the hotel before they became 5 Star.","3,0",DISGUSTING! I WILL NEVER COME BACK!! DO NOT BOOK HERE!,The Nalod Da Nang

Quant au petit déjeuner, la qualité laisse vraiment à désirer. Le buffet a diminué de 2 tiers mais en ces temps de pandémie et l’impact que cela a sur le tourisme, cela peut se comprendre.

Aufmerksamkeit (Kuchen) zum letzten Tag.,"Das Hotel scheint schon ziemlich alt zu sein, was der Ausstattung anzusehen ist. Dies zeigt sich auch im Fitnessstudio, das sehr sporadisch eingerichtet ist und allein vom Zustand der Geräte ein fortgeschrittenes Alter aufweist.

Die Qualität und der Service beim Frühstück (kostenlos inkl.) lassen zu Wünschen übrig. Nach dem zweiten Frühstück entschied ich mich lieber etwas anderes außerhalb des Hotels zu suchen. Das Frühstück wurde nur bis 9:30 Uhr angeboten, wobei ich beim ersten Frühstück bereits gegen 9:15 Uhr bestimmt darauf hingewiesen wurde, dass man gleich schließe. Meine Bestellungen wurden vergessen und trotz Nachfrage nicht nach einer zügigen Lösung gesucht. Das Essen schmeckte mir nicht (alles neutral oder abgestanden), obwohl es sehr auf vietnamesische Kunden ausgerichtet ist, was eigentlich eine bessere Qualität vermuten lässt.

Das Wifi könnte besser funktionieren. Mein erstes Zimmer ließ mir am zweiten Tag kein einloggen mehr zu, weshalb ich sogar ein kostenfreies Upgrade in ein Zimmer mit Seeblick erhielt (vielen Dank dafür!). Der Wechsel musste (?) aber in wenigen Minuten stattfinden, so Stand der Rezeptionist in meiner Tür und wartete auch dort bei offener Tür, selbst nachdem ich um ein paar Minuten Zeit bat. Das Wifi im neuen Zimmer funktionierte grundsätzlich, war aber langsam und auch nicht immer zuverlässig (kurzzeitig kein Internet oder keine Reaktion).

Leider war mein erstes Zimmer nicht ausreichend sauber. So fanden sich viele lange schwarze Haare in meiner Dusche, die definitiv nicht von mir stammen konnten. Grundsätzlich war daran anschließend alles sauber.

Alles in allem dominierte bei mir der Eindruck, dass trotz der zahlreichen Mitarbeiter des Hotels der Service qualitativ merklich ausbaufähig ist (es handelt sich um ein 5-Sterne-Hotel). Auch sollten die angebotenen Speisen, ob kostenfrei oder kostenpflichtig, eine hohe Qualität aufweisen, was sie aus meiner Sicht nicht taten.","6,0",Wird einem 5-Sterne-Hotel derzeit nicht gerecht,The Nalod Da Nang

But instead we got a call the morning with the news that we was upgraded to a bigger room with seaview. And this room is the most beautiful room I`ve ever stayed at! 
The room service was so good. They cleaned our room every morning, we got water two times a day and they fixed our room ready for night in the afternoon. 
The breakfast was good, with the cutest waiters. 
The gym was nice and new, and had all the equipments I needed for a full body workout. 
When we checked out the receptionist came after us with a present- it was a nice wooden model of the hotel. This was the perfect souvenir for us. 
I also loved the location- the beach was just over the road and there was many nice cafees and restaurants in short walking distance. The guards in the car park was always so nice when we came with our scooter. 
Highly recomment the hotel!","More aircondition in the hallways and in the elevator would be nice. But there was nothing I really didnt like.

Restaurant for breakfast was very good with western and Vietnamese options available. Evening quieter but the food choice again is good and very reasonable.
The beach opposite the hotel is clean and with plenty of space.
For us the big benefit was the hotel pool private and plenty of place to sit.
We used the hotel transfer to Danang airport ,very convenient and dropped us off at the domestic terminal for our flight to Hanoi.

Если б так и позиционировали они себя, я была бы довольна. Но это никак не 5 звезд.
Номера большие, но какие-то пустые и бестолковые, обшарпанные местами. Но это ладно, мы не сидеть в номере приехали. А вот спать как раз сложно. Да, вид из окон шикарный, очень красиво! Но очень шумно. Слышна дорога и постоянно сигналившие водители. Всю ночь играла музыка. Я просыпалась постоянно и даже в 5:30 утра музыка играла. А дальше по коридорам начали ходить туристы. Что оказалось еще более шумно. В общем, не выспались.
Прям рядом с отелем нет кафе, нужно прогуляться. Но я ставлю 5 за местоположение, тк мы любим гулять. До драконьего моста пешком 25 минут.
Завтрак, на мой взгляд, более азиатского состава. Я не против, но мне было не очень вкусно. Даже круассаны больше похожи на хлеб, чем на воздушную хрустящую выпечку.
Я не из тех людей, кто придирается ко всему, наоборот. Но, ребята, если вы называете себя пятизвездочным отелем, то нужно соответствовать. Посетите международные сетевые отели и сравните.

L'hotel ad un certo punto ombreggiava la spiaggia quindi per chi ama prendersi il sole non è consigliati lo stabilimento proprio di fronte ma magari meglio spostarsi in quelli più laterali, anche se abbiamo constatato che alla gente del posto piace stare proprio lì all'ombra quindi il problema era solo nostro.

The whole place is spacious as it resembles more like an apartment than a typical hotel where everything is crammed together.","The service was just OK and typical of larger hotels. The problem for us is that we have been spoilt by the quaint, smaller and more boutique hotels in places like Hanoi and Hoi An, where their service is impeccable and staff were eager to serve and pamper guests really well. It's not that Altara Suites' service is bad, but just in comparison, the care isn't as felt as the other hotels. Also, we were quite hard pressed to find good places to eat nearer the hotel, so we felt kind of ""stuck"".

The second dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in over 25 years of travelling the world. 

The lifts were absolutely filthy - finger marks everywhere, greasy and SO SLOW. There were 3 lifts in total, but it seemed only one worked, and people lined up for ages for the dirty lifts.

Jordan,Canada,Phòng gia đình,Suite Harmony Có 2 Phòng Ngủ và Ban Công,3 đêm,"We stayed in the Harmony 2 Bedroom 2 Bathroom suite. The photos from Booking.com are accurate. In person, I would argue its even better. The view was BREATHTAKING. We were in suite 2706 which also has a bathtub.

Everything was so clean and the staff were very welcoming and helpful. You are provided with a washer and dryer and a small amount of laundry powder. We received four complimentary bottles of water each day which was much needed.

Loved the rain shower head and the air conditioning worked well. Beds were very comfortable and there were three tvs (one in each bedroom and one in the living room) which could be used with Netflix, Prime, YouTube, etc

Breakfast was really enjoyable. Buffet style but also had an egg station with delicious omelettes. There was also a rotating menu of Vietnamese local noodles. If you get a chance, the local My Quang chicken noodle soup is delicious. Breakfast runs from 6:30 to 10:30 and you won't go hungry. Tons of variety and fresh juices (passionfruit, mango, watermelon, etc.) along with Vietnamese coffee, normal coffee, tea.. whatever you need.

The gym was basic but very clean and well maintained. The view from the gym was even better than the hotel room. First day the AC was off inside but after pointing this out, they promptly addressed it.

The swimming pool was a tad busy but very comfortable and had great service. The pool towels smelled extremely fresh which was nice.

Location is decent. Directly across from the beach. Lots of seafood restaurants down the street. Also a convenience store about 200m away walking distance.

That said, the prices are inflated - if you use Grab, take a 5 min ride down the road to Vincom Plaza (big mall) and go to the grocery store called Winmart where you will find much cheaper goods. Likely useful for longer stays or those who want to cook.","As others have mentioned, the elevators could be a bit frustrating and slow depending on the time of day. Only felt the AC on in them once for the three nights we stayed. I think part of the issue is the size of the property but also the fact that there are no separate service elevators. We rode with staff multiple times. Must be extremely frustrating for them and likely leads to problems with efficiency. 

However, this was a very minor inconvenience. The elevators were always clean and we're equipped with air freshener units. If you are staying on the 27th floor or higher, would recommend using the stairs to access the gym facilities and breakfast in the morning (if you are physically able).

The only other suggestion would be to bring an extension cord or a multi plug extender as there was only one outlet on each side of the bed in the bedroom. 

Finally, the bath towels did smell a bit musty but in my experience that is hard to avoid in seaside accommodations. If I am mistaken and there is a way to mitigate this, this would be my primary suggestion for Altara on easily achievable improvements.",10,Outstanding Service and Well Maintained Property,Altara Suites Da Nang by AHG

Die Ferienwohnung war sehr gut ausgestattet und wir hatten von hier aus einen tollen Ausblick. Das Apartment wurde täglich gereinigt. Die Poolanlage war sehr schön, aber auch zum Strand und der Promenade ist es nicht weit. Genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nähe..Das Frühstücksbuffett ist landestypisch, mit großer Auswahl und sehr lecker. Fazit: Wir kommen wieder!!!","Es gibt 3 Fahrstühle. Allerdings muss man hier viel Geduld aufbringen. Es dauert manchmal ewig, bis einer davon kommt. Das kennen wir von anderen Häusern besser! Wir waren 11 Nächte im Altara Suites. Für einen late check out von 4 Stunden sollten wir 900.000 VND bezahlen. Das fanden wir dann doch etwas viel.

Es war bis auf ein paar Kleinigkeiten alles vorhanden, was wir benötigt haben. Wir konnten in dem Appartement selbst kochen, da unsere Kindern mit dem vietnamesischen Essen nicht so gut zurecht kamen. Auch eine Waschmaschine und ein Wäschetrockner waren enthalten. Einen kleinen Balkon vor dem hinteren Schlafzimmer gab es auch, allerdings wurde mehr als die Hälfte der Fläche davon vom Außengerät der Klimaanlage in Anspruch genommen. Der Zimmerservice reinigte das Appartement inklusive der Küche jeden Tag. Unsere Kinder haben den kleinen Pool auf der Dachterrasse mit einer wunderschönen Aussicht geliebt. Das Personal war meist freundlich und hilfsbereit. Hervorzuheben sind die Mitarbeiter/innen im Hotelrestaurant, die sehr aufmerksam waren (Duyen, Hung etc). Insgesamt waren wir 8 Tage in dem Appartement.","Da der Rezeptionsbereich ziemlich klein war, war es nicht so angenehm, sich dort länger aufzuhalten. Auch die Toilette neben der Rezeption könnte sauberer sein, um den Anspruch eines gehobenen Aparthotels gerecht zu werden. Die Besetzung an der Rezeption war nicht optimal, mal standen dort 4-5 Mitarbeiter/innen herum, die wenig zu tun hatten und mal war es nur von einer Person besetzt, als auf ein Mal viele Gäste ankamen. Oft haben wir zu lange auf den Fahrstuhl warten müssen, da es nur 3 Fahrstühle im ganzen Building mit 39 (?) Stockwerken gibt. Der Buffetaufbau im Restaurants kann definitiv besser organisiert werden. Ständiges Drängeln am Buffet war absolut unnötig, auch weil manche Gäste nicht wussten, wo das Ende einer Warteschlange war. Das Frühstücksangebot für Kinder war leider sehr dürftig. Unsere Kinder im Alter von 6 und 12 J. kamen sich im Frühstücksrestaurant verloren vor, weil die Speisen fast nur für Erwachsene ausgerichtet waren. Vielleicht würde die Einrichtung eines ""Kid corner"" im Frühstücksrestaurant den Service aufwerten. Die Ausstattung der Küchenutensilien kann auch verbessert werden. Was uns auffiel, war, dass wir nirgendswo in den insgesamt 5 Appartements, in den wir auf unserer Vietnam-Reise aufgehalten haben, ein Schneidebrett gefunden haben.

На 5ти звездочный отель не тянет. Полотенце были старыми,с дырками и один раз принесли полотенце с плохо застиранной кровью. Когда мы им его показали,сказали: Ничего страшного,мы вам его поменяем. Был ещё не очень приятный момент. Испачкали полотенце краской для волос,дочь помыла голову и вытерла полотенцем,осталась краска. Полотенце даже не попробовав постирать выставили счёт как за новое,а оно было очень старое.от старости уже нитки торчали. Я предложила им постирать его сама,и если не отстирается то я заплачу за него. Постирала его в стиральной машинке и он все отстиралось без проблем.

There's also a really great cafe called indigo that's 2-3 minutes walk away from the hotel.,"Novotel is a ""tourist"" hotel, meaning those huge tourist groups you see in tour buses stay here. It makes breakfast a chaotic experience, because there's just SO many people. It's not such a big deal, but sometimes, you just want the peace and quiet hahahaha! I also don't really like how their tour offers are not so comprehensive. It's not bad, but I can't help and compare it to the previous hotel we stayed at in Hanoi. Here, they only offer car services without city/tour guides.

We booked this hotel as a one off for my birthday and the room and facilities did not disappoint. The swimming pool and view is beautiful and they have a restaurant on the same floor. For lunch we had some great food and the price is as expected a little more than you would normally pay in Vietnam. For our evening meal the menu was the same however they do advertise a sea food BBQ and Al a carte Menu but this was not given to us as an option and the bottle of wine we chose was not available. We were the only ones who dined during this time and the restaurant was completely empty. There is a lift to the sky bar from the hotel, this is not the same company as the hotel, but they do promote it, so we chose to have a drink there for the experience. The cocktails were triple the price (350,000 dong +) and they were handing out wet towels as you sat there and then charged you for them on the bill. This ruined our hotel experience. Overall it was a nice and different experience but I think I will stick to the cheaper hotels in future.","7,0",Extremely expensive but great views,Novotel Danang Premier Han River

Thank you.,The worst is the room service. Oh come on 5 star hotel takes 45 mins to bring 2 glasses of red wine... that is totally unacceptable. My advise... improve your room service delivery timing.. simply disappointing. And they lie alot. After 20 mins i called they said the order should reach me in 5 mins. Then after 30 mins they said on the way. After 45 mins they said 2 mins... that's really but service. Novatel being 5 star means your service quality as to be top notch.

2. 이그제큐티브 실망스러웠습니다
이그제큐티브 옵션을 선택한만큼 라운지 이용에 기대가 많았는데 코로나 이후 중단하고 레노베이션 준비중이라는 말을 미리 호텔 측에서 알려주지 않았습니다. 

더 어이 없는건,가니까 조식도, 에프터눈티, 이브닝 칵테일 모두 그냥 일반 객실 손님들과 같이 4층에서 먹었네요. 추가지불이 그렇게 적은 것도 아닌데 누릴 수 있는건 너무 없고, 그에 대한 보상 따로 없습니다. 

서비스는 또 어떻게 불친절하고 음식 서빙도 느렸는지, 절대 이그제큐티브 비추입니다! 가성비최악. (직원들 자체가 이그제큐티브 룸의 개념을 모르는듯. 교육 제대로 시켜야할듯) 

객실 청결도랑 도심위치인것 빼면 굳이 여기 묵어야하네요. 스카이36 재밌다고 해서 접근성 좋으려고 여기했는데 클럽은 정말 재미없습니다. 굳이 여기 묵지 마시고 더 가성비 좋은 호텔 가시길","4,0",5성급 호텔이라기엔 너무 실망스러운 서비스 (이그제큐티브 라운지 운영 안합니다),Novotel Danang Premier Han River

Jia,Malaysia,Cặp đôi,GRAND SUITE GARDEN BALCONY BATHTUB,3 đêm,"This may be the prettiest hotel I've ever stayed at; every single corner of our room looks amazing, we even took notes and inspiration for an upcoming house renovation lol.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful; their english is not the best but if you speak slowly they can hold a conversation. I love that you can borrow the umbrellas and bicycles for free, perfect to cycle down to the beach which is just down the road. The staff will also happily give you food recommendations and point out which spots are touristy and which are the local ones.

This may be unconventional, but my favourite thing about Saha Casa is actually the breakfast! You won't get a continental-style breakfast buffet (though I think they have sausages and eggs as one of the breakfast options) but a slim selection of porridge / chicken soup / noodles made with ginseng (a type of herb). I grew up in an oriental household and this reminded me of the time my grandmother stayed with us and made us breakfasts everyday. Extremely wholesome and nourishing! They would also happily bring your breakfast to your room for you if you request.

PS: Do yourself a favour and check out The Whale, which is a small cocktail bar just next door. I had one of the BEST cocktails I've ever had in my life there. Literally just next door, so you can let yourself get a little tipsy ;)","(This is NOT a reflection of shortcomings of the hotel, but merely some notes to the management for improvement)
- I wish there was a full length mirror in the room.
- We could have used some cutleries too.
- The blinds in the bathroom don't 'stick' closely to the glass window, meaning that people outside can look inside towards the shower and the tub, especially if the lights are on at night... It's such a shame because the bath was beautiful; we ended up buying some tape to tape it down temporarily.

주간에 계속 공사 소리 들려서 쉬지를 못함.
그렇다고 공사한다는 공지도 없었음.
물이 너무 비쌈. 6-7병 마신거 같은데 30만동 가까이 나오는게 말이 되나ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
밤 11시 좀 넘으면 로비 사람도 없고, 호텔 불 다 꺼져서 일정하고 좀 늦게 복귀하면 개무서움.. 그랩 택시기사도 호텔 불 다 꺼져서 매번 지나침. 호텔이 불 꺼지는게 말이 안됨. 한국 모텔도 켜 놓는데ㅋㅋㅋ 새벽에 들어온 것도 아니고;; 
조식도 뷔페식 조식을 선호하는 편이라 음식 하나 딱 나오는게… 호텔이라고 하기엔 매우 부족함. 맛도 별로임. 4박 5일동안 하루 먹어보고 걍 안 먹음.(4일동안의 다른 호텔에서는 다 먹었는데 오죽했으면 안 먹었겠냐)
직원들 영어도 못해서 의사소통 거의 불가능. 조식 주는 직원한테 숟가락이랑 포크 하나 달라고 말했는데 못 알아들음.
딱히 사진 스팟도 없음.(주변 다 공사하고 있고, 건물은 골목길에 한국 모텔보다 작은 사이즈임)
참고로 55제곱미터 예약했는데 실평수는 그 정도 절대 안되는듯 생각보다 작음.

결론: 수영장 물 더러워서 20분 정도 잡고 사진만 찍는 느낌으로 있다가 수압 좋은 물로 씻고 나가세요. 물은 밖에서 사서 마시고 조식 맛 없으니까 군대 왔다고 생각하고 드세요. 일찍 나가서 일찍 들어오세요(밤에 들어오면 ㄹㅇ 개무섭고 하루는 깜깜한 구석에서 직원이 갑자기 튀어나와서 호러 체험까지 했네요)

A piscina de borda infinita é um passeio em sí só, ficamos o dia do aniversário do meu marido apenas na piscina e na praia (na frente) e foi super agradável. Tem roupão e chinelos disponíveis sempre. Além disso, o café da manhã é excelente, um buffet super completo, tendo tanto opções ocidentais quanto locais vietnamitas (tinha uma estação de Pho, além de diversas outras comidas) e o serviço da equipe do salão durante o café também é extremamente eficiente - sempre perguntando se desejamos algo mais ou retirando pratos sujos a cada 2 minutos. 

Um ponto super legal desse hotel é o Aftenoon Tea que eles oferecem diariamente. Tem várias comidinhas deliciosas, doces e até pizza. E além disso, na nossa reserva tínhamos também direito a 30 minutos de sauna todo dia, o que foi super legal.

Além disso, eles prestam muita atenção aos detalhes: um carinho do staff no dia do aniversário do meu marido. Eu havia avisado na reserva que estávamos comemorando aniversário e quando chegamos no quarto, à noite, eles tinham deixado um bolinho com macarons e um cartão de parabéns muito fofo escrito pela Ms. Hanh Nguyen, a diretora de sales and marketing. ❤️

There was no turn down service but I think they were just too busy.,"Although the staff were helpful and tied their best it was way too busy and the hotel wasn’t equipped to deal with the tour group visitors and the foreigners coming for a major event. 
Breakfast was hectic. People pushing past you to get to the food. Tables jammed in too close to each other. It wasn’t peaceful at all. They had huge Asian tour groups so the food was catered to them mostly. No egg station for omelettes. Eggs were already fried and stacked in a pile so they were stone cold when you tried to eat. No fresh coffee which was the worst. Only Vietnamese coffee or instant powdered coffee. I wouldn’t recommend going down early for it. Huge lines for lifts to get to and from the rooms. 
They advertise an amazing roof top bar but literally only day we stayed due to the event on the US carrier and couldn’t get a quiet drink at the bar because they close it on Mondays!! I think given the event they could have considered keeping it open.","7,0",It was ok for a work trip and convenient for the meeting place but I won’t be back in a hurry.,Wyndham Danang Golden Bay
Adriana,Thụy Sỹ,Cặp đôi,Phòng Deluxe Golden Bay Có Giường Cỡ King Với Ban Công Và Tầm Nhìn Ra Vịnh,1 đêm,"The only thing they're good at is photoshop. The photos of the facilities are a lie, especially the pool. The room was good, but that was the only positive. The restaurant on 1st floor almost sent my husband to the hospital. I informed them of his allergy and stomach sickness, and asked 5 times for a not spicy meal beforehand. They brought a flaming-red, most spicy ramen we've ever tried (which wasn't indicated in the menu), and instead of apologizing, they defended stubbornly and just changed the water of the soup, but kept the rest and the chilies on top, which was still very spicy. We were forced to pay, even though we almost had to go BACK to the hospital because of this ""mistake"". Anyone can make a mistake, but amend after, and the whole staff did the opposite. The restaurant on the rooftop was ok though, and informed about my husband's state.","The hotel feels like a post-apocalyptic, post-communist war, ghost motel. We felt a really creepy vibe, especially in the pool (which is the reason most people go). Everything is rusted, old. The sun loungers are dirty and the towels have holes in them. The casino tv's in the lifts are super annoying. The staff is also incapable, they forgot one of our 2 big suitcases in the room when checking out, and defended themselves not believing there was another one, I was forced to go with to prove them.","2,0","Horrible ghost hotel, one of the worst!

Ellen,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),Cặp đôi,Phòng Superior có Giường cỡ Queen và Nhìn ra Thành phố,2 đêm,"- Extremely close to the airport, which is the reason why we booked here, since we had an early flight to Phu Quoc after our stay at Danang, it took us only 6 minutes to arrive at the airport.

- The room looks better than the photos. Satisfyingly clean. Bathroom has a modern design. Nothing exceptional but it felt very comfortable.

- We were given upon check-in a voucher for 2 complimentary welcome drinks at the bar, though we did not find the time to use it, it was a nice touch.","- Some staff were extremely petty and rude. We were staying only for 2 nights so we did not bother to have housekeeping clean our room. Instead, we called front desk in the late afternoon and asked only to replace the water (2 per room per night) and the petite little bottle of hair conditioner that we finished. The front desk staff at the phone only agreed to replace the water after what sounded to me like a rude interrogation with an unpleasant tone. (""We gave you water"", ""There is already water"". ""Did you see the 2 water by the sink?"", ""Did you finish the water?"" and finally ""Okay, I will mark down that we give you your 2 FREE water for today."") Which was already shocking to me, but she doubled down with telling me we can only get 1 bottle of hair conditioner for 1 room and refused to give me a new one or a refill. Is that the official policy of an international 5-star hotel? I have stayed in plenty of similar hotels all over the world and I have never heard of that before.

- Food from the breakfast was subpar. Most things were either too salty or tasteless. The whole fruits (Vietnamese apples, rose apples) were either rotting or rotten when you cut them open. Pre-sliced fruits were fine though.

- If you have a noisy neighbour in the connecting room, it can ruin your night of sleep. The Korean couple that stayed next to us had a big argument during one night of our stay and woke us up a few times.

- No one offered to show us our room or help us with our luggages when we checked in, even when the hotel staff did not look busy when we arrived. We are 2 grown adults who are perfectly capable of doing so ourselves but were very surprised it was not offered. We also had to ask when and where breakfast would be served since no one mentioned anything at check in.","6,0","Clean Comfortable Hotel close to the Airport, with Unprofessional Staff and Poor Breakfast",Grand Mercure Danang
